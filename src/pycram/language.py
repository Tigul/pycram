"""Implementation of the CRAM language.

Macros:
seq -- macro to execute statements sequentially and fail if one fails, succeed after all succeeded.
par -- macro to execute statements in parallel and fail if one fails, succeed after all succeeded.
pursue -- macro to execute statements in parallel and fail if one fails, succeed after one succeeded.
try_all -- macro to execute statements in parallel and fail if all fail, succeed after one succeeded.
try_in_order -- macro to execute statements sequentially and fail if all fail, succeed after one succeeded.
failure_handling -- macro to wrap the body into a function named retry which can be called to execute it again.

Classes:
State -- enumeration to describe the result of a macro.
